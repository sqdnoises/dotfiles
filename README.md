<sub>*my [`.gitconfig`](.gitconfig) contains my username and email for `git`. you might want to change it to your username and email if you don't wanna commit as me. or you can add `.gitconfig` to [`exclusions.txt`](exclusions.txt) and it should not put my gitconfig or replace yours if you have setup git before.</sub>

## Setup
### Prerequisites
- Linux-based system (Debian/Ubuntu)
- `sudo` privileges for installing packages

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sqdnoises/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ```
2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ./install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```
3. Restart your terminal or source the `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. Delete the newly created `dotfiles` directory: (optional)
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/dotfiles
    ```

- All in one of the above, skipping the confirmation prompt: (copy, paste and forget):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sqdnoises/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
   chmod +x ./install.sh && ./install.sh -y # -y flag for skipping confirmation prompt
   source ~/.bashrc
   rm -rf ~/dotfiles # optional
   ```


### Flags
- Use `-y` to skip confirmation prompts:
  ```bash
  ./install.sh -y
  ```

## Customization
It is recommended to fork this repository and edit the files to suit your needs since this one includes my settings and configuration.

To add new dotfiles:
1. Place your configuration file in the root of this repository.
2. Add any files you want to exclude to `exclusions.txt`.

```
